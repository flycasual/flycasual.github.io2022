Established in 2018, La Crosse-based Fly Casual and with a focus on nostalgic tunes from the 80’s, 90’s, and 2000’s, this cover band’s energy and stage presence create a fun atmosphere for audiences of all ages. The band’s repertoire features a variety of rock ranging from Rush to Cyndi Lauper to Shania Twain to Kansas.

The five-member combo sports a lead vocalist, guitar, bass, keyboard, and drums. Between them, the members of the band have over 50 collective years of experience in music performance. Music degrees and other formal training coupled with diverse past work spanning jazz, funk, bluegrass, rock, and sacred music add to the band’s adaptability: pre-negotiated song requests from wedding receptions are quickly added to their selection.

The band performs at local music venues, social events, weddings, and more in Wisconsin and Minnesota. Fly Casual also plays for select charitable and community events including Make Music La Crosse, the United Way, local cancer benefits, and Artspire.
